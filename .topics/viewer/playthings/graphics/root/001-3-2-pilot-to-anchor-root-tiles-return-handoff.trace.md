# Root Tiles — Pilot To Anchor Return

## Handoff Parties

- Purpose: return one exact approved-for-return Root Tiles candidate PNG plus truthful execution Evidence to Anchor and stop
- From: Pilot
- From Kind: role
- From Reference: [Pilot Role](business::.topics/roles/001-7-pilot-role.trace.md)
- To: Anchor
- To Kind: role
- To Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)

## Transfers

- candidate-png
  - Transfer Kind: work
  - Description: preserve and return the exact generated Root Tiles candidate PNG for Anchor/Sigma inspection, deterministic normalization, runtime reduction, and acceptance decision
  - Controlling Artifact: [Root Tiles — Anchor To Pilot](001-3-anchor-to-pilot-root-tiles-generation-handoff.trace.md)
  - Boundary: Sigma approved the current generated output for return and instructed no more image generation; runtime acceptance remains retained by Anchor/Sigma

- execution-evidence
  - Transfer Kind: work
  - Description: return the truthful execution Evidence including exact candidate identity, approval state, transient return interruption, and the human-mediated execution deviation
  - Controlling Artifact: [Root Tiles Generation Execution Evidence](001-3-1-root-tiles-generation-execution-evidence.trace.md)
  - Boundary: Evidence records deviation rather than claiming strict process compliance

- terminal-stop
  - Transfer Kind: responsibility
  - Description: stop Pilot creative work after manufacturing this return package and do not continue into another Root channel or runtime integration
  - Boundary: no further image generation

## Required Context

- root-tiles-candidate
  - Material: exact approved-for-return Root Tiles generation candidate PNG
  - Material Reference: [Root Tiles generation candidate](001-3-1-generated-01.png)
  - Purpose: source image for retained Anchor/Sigma inspection and deterministic normalization/runtime reduction
  - Availability: available

- execution-evidence
  - Material: truthful Root Tiles generation execution Evidence
  - Material Reference: [Root Tiles Generation Execution Evidence](001-3-1-root-tiles-generation-execution-evidence.trace.md)
  - Purpose: preserve candidate identity, approval state, execution sequence, and deviations
  - Availability: available

## Reference Context

- source-handoff
  - Material: original Anchor-to-Pilot Root Tiles generation Handoff
  - Material Reference: [Root Tiles — Anchor To Pilot](001-3-anchor-to-pilot-root-tiles-generation-handoff.trace.md)
  - Purpose: controlling generation request, terminal token, retained responsibilities, and process boundary
  - Availability: available

- named-sheet-contract
  - Material: accepted six-channel named Playthings PNG companion contract
  - Material Reference: [Named Sheet Contract](../001-playthings-named-sheet-companion-contract-decision.trace.md)
  - Purpose: runtime companion naming and resolver boundary
  - Availability: available

- tiles-template
  - Material: accepted dynamic Playthings Tiles family template
  - Material Reference: [Tiles Template](../001-1-playthings-tiles-dynamic-family-template-decision.trace.md)
  - Purpose: deterministic 8×8 family slot grammar and 32×32 runtime target
  - Availability: available

## Retained Responsibilities

- acceptance-and-normalization
  - Retained By: Anchor; Sigma
  - Responsibility: inspect the exact source, run deterministic type-specific normalization/runtime reduction, compare source↔derivative, and accept or reject
  - Boundary: the returned candidate is approved for return but Pilot return does not independently establish runtime acceptance or integration PASS

## Exclusions And Dependencies

- no-ambient-continuation
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not continue into another Root channel or runtime integration after return manufacture
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Pilot

- no-more-image-generation
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: Sigma explicitly instructed that no more image generation occur for this return
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Pilot

- runtime-qualification-dependent
  - Kind: unresolved-dependency
  - Description: deterministic normalization, 32×32 reduction, source↔derivative comparison, resolver testing, and final acceptance remain required before runtime authority may be claimed
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Anchor; Sigma

## Completion Expectation

- Signal Kind: return
- Signal Meaning: one exact approved-for-return candidate PNG plus truthful execution Evidence and the Pilot-to-Anchor return package
- Return To: Anchor
- Return To Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)
- Expected Result Reference: [Root Tiles generation candidate](001-3-1-generated-01.png)

## Interpretation Limits

- Does Not Mean: return manufacture proves strict compliance with the human-mediated execution process, deterministic slot correctness, accepted runtime reduction, or Root integration PASS
- Must Not Be Used To Claim: generated pixels create Tiinex semantics or that Pilot has superseded Anchor/Sigma acceptance authority
- Authority Limits: candidate and Evidence are return materials; retained acceptance and normalization authority remains with Anchor/Sigma
- Review Notes: execution Evidence explicitly records the Pilot-held generation deviation and the exact preserved candidate identity
