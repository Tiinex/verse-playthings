# Root Props — Pilot To Anchor Return

## Handoff Parties

- Purpose: return the exact current Root Props candidate plus truthful execution/deviation evidence to Anchor for deterministic normalization, review, and accept/reject disposition, then stop Pilot work
- From: Pilot
- From Kind: role
- From Reference: [Pilot Role](business::.topics/roles/001-7-pilot-role.trace.md)
- To: Anchor
- To Kind: role
- To Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)

## Transfers

- root-props-candidate
  - Transfer Kind: work-and-responsibility
  - Description: return the exact byte-preserved Root Props generation candidate for Anchor/Sigma inspection, deterministic normalization/runtime reduction, comparison, and disposition
  - Controlling Artifact: [Root Props Generation Execution Evidence](001-4-1-pilot-root-props-generation-evidence.trace.md)
  - Boundary: candidate is transient execution evidence, not yet the stable `root.playthings.props.png` runtime companion

- execution-deviation-review
  - Transfer Kind: work-and-responsibility
  - Description: return the truthful execution record, including direct Pilot-side generation substitution and the two failed post-terminal image-generation tool calls, so Anchor/Sigma can decide whether those deviations require rejection or a separately authorized retry
  - Controlling Artifact: [Root Props Generation Execution Evidence](001-4-1-pilot-root-props-generation-evidence.trace.md)
  - Boundary: Pilot does not self-accept the deviations or infer that they are harmless

## Required Context

- root-props-generation-evidence
  - Material: exact bounded-execution Evidence
  - Material Reference: [Root Props Generation Execution Evidence](001-4-1-pilot-root-props-generation-evidence.trace.md)
  - Purpose: preserve output identity, execution facts, fidelity limits, and deviations
  - Availability: available

- root-props-generated-candidate
  - Material: exact current Root Props PNG candidate
  - Material Reference: [Root Props generated candidate](001-4-1-generated-01.png)
  - Purpose: source bytes for Anchor/Sigma visual/technical review and deterministic normalization
  - Availability: available

- anchor-role
  - Material: generic Business Anchor Role
  - Material Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)
  - Purpose: declared return-role authority and review boundary
  - Availability: available

## Reference Context

- controlling-generation-handoff
  - Material: original Anchor-to-Pilot bounded generation Handoff
  - Material Reference: [Root Props — Anchor To Pilot](001-4-anchor-to-pilot-root-props-generation-handoff.trace.md)
  - Purpose: exact generation request, terminal-return contract, retry limit, retained responsibilities, and exclusions
  - Availability: available

- named-sheet-contract
  - Material: accepted six-channel named companion contract
  - Material Reference: [Playthings Named Sheet Companion Contract](../001-playthings-named-sheet-companion-contract-decision.trace.md)
  - Purpose: fixed Props eight-state grammar and stable-filename boundary
  - Availability: available

## Retained Responsibilities

- acceptance-and-normalization
  - Retained By: Anchor; Sigma
  - Responsibility: inspect the exact returned source, run deterministic type-specific normalization/runtime reduction, compare source↔derivative, assess execution deviations, and accept or reject the candidate
  - Boundary: Pilot return, package qualification, and Sigma's approval to preserve/return the current output do not by themselves establish Root runtime integration PASS

## Exclusions And Dependencies

- no-further-generation
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not generate, edit, retry, or creatively revise the Root Props image after this return; any future retry requires a new explicit authorization from Anchor/Sigma
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Pilot

- no-stable-promotion-by-pilot
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not promote the transient generated candidate directly into stable domain asset storage or claim it as accepted `root.playthings.props.png`
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Pilot

## Completion Expectation

- Signal Kind: return
- Signal Meaning: exact candidate PNG and truthful execution Evidence are packaged and returned to Anchor; Pilot stops without further image generation or Root integration work
- Return To: Anchor
- Return To Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)
- Expected Result Reference: [Root Props Generation Execution Evidence](001-4-1-pilot-root-props-generation-evidence.trace.md)

## Interpretation Limits

- Does Not Mean: the returned candidate is already normalized, accepted, promoted, or runtime-qualified as `root.playthings.props.png`
- Must Not Be Used To Claim: Root Props integration PASS, provider-internal prompt fidelity, or that the recorded process deviations are acceptable without Anchor/Sigma review
- Review Notes: Sigma explicitly approved preserving the current output and requested no further image generation; Anchor/Sigma retain deterministic normalization, comparison, and final disposition authority
