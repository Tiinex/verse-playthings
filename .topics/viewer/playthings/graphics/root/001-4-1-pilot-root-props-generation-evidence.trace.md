# Root Props Generation Execution Evidence

## Preserved Material

- Material Description: exact PNG candidate returned by the bounded Root Props generation execution, showing one persistent brass-and-dark-wood utility crate/tool chest across the requested eight state columns
- Material Kind: image/png
- Material Reference: [Root Props generated candidate](001-4-1-generated-01.png)
- Represented Subject: one generic Root-world persistent prop row for the `root.playthings.props.png` channel
- Source: bounded Pilot execution context controlled by [Root Props — Anchor To Pilot](001-4-anchor-to-pilot-root-props-generation-handoff.trace.md)

## Preservation Act

- Preservation Method: byte-for-byte filesystem copy of the exact returned PNG into lineage-local execution evidence; no decode, resave, crop, resize, or other pixel transformation
- Preservation Time Or State: after Sigma explicitly approved preserving the current output and requested Tiinex return manufacture; before return-package manufacture
- Actor: Pilot
- Tool: host image-generation result capture plus local byte copy and digest inspection
- Capture Conditions: the successful generated file was locally available as exact bytes; later failed tool calls did not replace or modify those bytes

## Provenance

- Known Source: the current bounded Root Props execution in which IMAGE 1 and the exact human-visible generation request from the controlling Handoff were presented, followed by one successful integrated image-generation result
- Provenance Limits: the controlling Handoff required human-mediated external execution and explicitly excluded Pilot-side generation substitution, but Pilot directly invoked the integrated image-generation tool; provider-internal prompt compilation, hidden preprocessing, and hidden model state are not observed or claimed
- Preservation Basis: exact returned PNG bytes were available locally and independently hashable before return manufacture
- Source Artifact: [Root Props — Anchor To Pilot](001-4-anchor-to-pilot-root-props-generation-handoff.trace.md)
- Capture Time: 2026-09-08 bounded execution session before 00:35 CEST return manufacture
- Custody Context: transient lineage-local execution/review material, not stable product/reference placement

## Fidelity And Loss

- Fidelity Notes: preserved candidate is 2172×724 px RGBA PNG with SHA-256 `1b988985f9ad2e0deb85b8b6640faddc56d99db835d16a9558760c108bba72c7`; the lineage-local copy is byte-identical to the successful generated result
- Known Losses: provider-internal generation compilation/state and any unavailable hidden generation parameters are not preserved; no claim is made that visible input bytes were forwarded unchanged inside the provider
- Transformation: none to the preserved candidate bytes
- Uncertainty: Sigma explicitly approved the current output for preservation and handoff, while Anchor's deterministic normalization, source-to-derivative comparison, runtime qualification, and final integration disposition remain pending

## Custody Or Storage Boundary

- Storage Or Custody State: transient lineage-local execution evidence carried in the Pilot-to-Anchor return package
- Reuse Boundary: may be used by Anchor/Sigma for review, deterministic normalization, comparison, and acceptance/rejection; must not be treated as the stable `root.playthings.props.png` runtime companion merely because it was generated or returned
- Retention: retain with the active execution/return lineage until Anchor/Sigma assigns a stable or rejected disposition
- Permission Boundary: return manufacture grants no remote write, publication, deployment, or stable-asset promotion authority

## Interpretation Limits

- Does Not Prove: exact provider-internal prompt fidelity, compliance of a future normalized derivative, Root resolver/runtime integration PASS, or Tiinex semantic authority from pixels
- Not Yet Used As: stable `root.playthings.props.png` production/runtime companion
- Must Not Be Treated As: automatic product acceptance or proof that the execution-process deviations were harmless
- Possible Evidence Use: exact source for Anchor's visual/technical inspection and deterministic runtime normalization
- Need For Review: Anchor/Sigma should decide whether the direct Pilot generation substitution and the post-terminal tool-call deviations require rejection or retry before stable promotion

## Supported Claim Or Question

- Supported Claim Or Question: one exact Root Props PNG candidate was successfully generated, preserved byte-for-byte, and is the current Sigma-approved-for-return candidate from this bounded execution
- Evidence Role: execution-result identity, byte-fidelity evidence, and truthful deviation record
- Target Artifact: Root Props named companion production under [Complete Root Named Companion Suite](001-root-complete-named-companion-suite-task.trace.md)
- Review Context: return to Anchor for source inspection, deterministic normalization/runtime reduction, comparison, and accept/reject disposition

## Evidence Material

- Material: [001-4-1-generated-01.png](001-4-1-generated-01.png)
- Material Kind: image/png
- Description: exact 2172×724 RGBA candidate; SHA-256 `1b988985f9ad2e0deb85b8b6640faddc56d99db835d16a9558760c108bba72c7`
- Attachment Reference: [lineage-local exact candidate](001-4-1-generated-01.png)

## Preservation And Fidelity

- Preservation State: exact bytes preserved and hash-verified locally before package manufacture
- Fidelity Notes: lineage-local PNG is byte-identical to the successful generated result; no pixel transform was performed
- Known Losses: hidden provider execution state is unavailable; the chat/tool host exposed no independently verifiable provider-internal prompt transcript
- Transformation: none
- Representation Limits: dimensions and byte identity are transport facts only; they do not establish runtime-template acceptance
- Storage Boundary: active `.topics` execution lineage only until owning-role disposition

## Execution Record

- Controlling Request: [Root Props — Anchor To Pilot](001-4-anchor-to-pilot-root-props-generation-handoff.trace.md)
- Ordered Visual Material: IMAGE 1 was the accepted Workspace place-style seed `.topics/viewer/playthings/graphics/root/001-root-place-style-reference.png`, whose carried SHA-256 was `ce3b916b43bbf07f5302e6672db9dd9ade8b78a700c6fdec618d319cad153fda`
- Human-Visible Input: the exact generation request declared in the controlling Handoff was rendered, and Sigma then submitted that request together with IMAGE 1
- Successful Generation Results: 1 exact candidate, preserved as [001-4-1-generated-01.png](001-4-1-generated-01.png)
- Material Process Deviation: Pilot directly invoked the integrated image-generation action instead of only guiding a human-operated external execution, contrary to the Handoff's `no-pilot-generation-substitution` exclusion
- Terminal Boundary Deviation: after Sigma sent `continue to return`, two later image-generation tool calls were mistakenly attempted instead of immediately manufacturing the return; both failed and produced no replacement candidate bytes
- Final Human Disposition: Sigma explicitly stated `Approved. No more image generation. Create and return the Tiinex handoff package from the current approved output.`
- Retry State: no successful second generation occurred; the preserved candidate remains the first successful result
