  - Authors: Anchor; Sigma
  - Why: Migrate the accepted Sigma Character bytes from the earlier generic experimental filename/manifest convention into the locked named Playthings companion contract.
  - Summary: Sigma Character v1 production authority is the named `.playthings.character.png` PNG; the old manifest is historical assembly/debug material, not required runtime authority.
  - Status: accepted/local

# Sigma Character Named Companion Migration

## Decision

- State: accepted.
- Historical lineage source remains `001-1-1-5-6-1-sigma.playthings.png`, SHA-256 `853246ec9827bb2092e7efcf3db6c5e41894745b2ced662b144211d45ddd603c`.
- Accepted Sigma Character v1 source remains `001-1-1-5-6-1-sigma.playthings.png` in this lineage. It is not duplicated into a production tree; a future schema companion may reference or derive from it when a real schema binding is accepted.
- The historical `sigma.playthings.manifest.json` was useful during assembly but is not a required or durable runtime companion under the later named-companion contract.

## Basis

- Named companion channels are now explicit through `.playthings.character.png`, `.playthings.verb.png`, `.playthings.blueprint.png`, `.playthings.portrait.png`, `.playthings.tiles.png`, and `.playthings.props.png`.
- Runtime must infer the companion family from the filename/type template rather than a generic `.playthings.png` plus sidecar manifest.

## Consequences

- New code and documentation should reference `sigma.playthings.character.png` for production use.
- The old generic filename remains only as historical lineage evidence and must not be used as the naming pattern for new companions.
- No per-character Playthings JSON manifest is required for baseline runtime interpretation.
