  - Authors: Anchor; Sigma
  - Why: Re-emit the refined Playthings checkpoint after correcting same-event asset dimensions and enforce the canonical Tiinex human transport projection rather than a manually renamed Handoff package.
  - Summary: Corrected full-workspace Anchor-to-Anchor Playthings continuation using Tooling-owned package filename and routing text.
  - Status: ready/local

# Playthings Corrected Source Transport — Anchor To Anchor

## Handoff Parties

- Purpose: continue from the corrected Playthings source checkpoint with same-event asset naming, no reference tree, complete Site/Business/Docs Workspaces, and canonical Tiinex human transport emission
- From: Anchor
- From Kind: role
- From Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)
- To: Anchor
- To Kind: role
- To Reference: [Anchor Role](business::.topics/roles/001-1-anchor-role.trace.md)

## Transfers

- corrected-playthings-source
  - Transfer Kind: work-and-responsibility
  - Description: use the carried Site Workspace as the current source baseline; lineage-local non-final assets now share the exact numeric dimension of their controlling event, with attachment ordering expressed only at the end of the slug
  - Controlling Artifact: [Playthings Co-Event Asset Prefix Correction Evidence](001-1-3-playthings-coevent-asset-prefix-correction-evidence.trace.md)
  - Boundary: do not reintroduce numeric child dimensions merely to order assets created by the same lineage event

- canonical-handoff-emission
  - Transfer Kind: work-and-responsibility
  - Description: future human Handoff delivery uses Tooling-projected `humanOutput.primary.filename` plus exact `humanOutput.normalInlineRouting.content`
  - Controlling Artifact: [Playthings Co-Event Asset Dimension And Handoff Emission Revision](../processes/001-1-playthings-coevent-asset-dimension-and-handoff-emission-revision.trace.md)
  - Boundary: do not manually rename canonical carrier output or reconstruct its transport address from memory

- runtime-rebase-frontier
  - Transfer Kind: work-and-responsibility
  - Description: retain the previous runtime-rebase frontier; discuss the Root Gate/workshop world-assembler, tile-compiler, resolver, multi-floor, roof/cutaway, and story-projection architecture before broad runtime replacement
  - Controlling Artifact: [Playthings Runtime Rebase Plan](001-2-playthings-runtime-rebase-plan-decision.trace.md)
  - Boundary: cleanup and transport correction do not themselves authorize a renderer rewrite

## Required Context

- previous-handoff
  - Material: preceding refined runtime-rebase Handoff
  - Material Reference: [Playthings Refined Runtime Rebase — Anchor To Anchor](001-3-anchor-to-anchor-playthings-refined-runtime-rebase-handoff.trace.md)
  - Purpose: preserve the discussion/runtime frontier already transferred
  - Availability: available

  - Material: concrete same-event asset path correction Evidence
  - Material Reference: [Playthings Co-Event Asset Prefix Correction Evidence](001-1-3-playthings-coevent-asset-prefix-correction-evidence.trace.md)

  - Material: complete Docs Workspace

  - Purpose: schema authority
  - Availability: available

## Retained Responsibilities

- commit-and-push
  - Retained By: Sigma
  - Responsibility: review and commit/push the corrected source checkpoint
  - Boundary: Handoff manufacture does not imply remote Git mutation

- runtime-experience-direction
  - Retained By: Sigma; Anchor
  - Responsibility: agree the next runtime slice before broad implementation
  - Boundary: current source remains a checkpoint, not runtime acceptance

## Exclusions And Dependencies

- no-reference-tree
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not recreate repository-root `reference/` for Playthings production/staging
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Anchor

- no-false-asset-children
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not use numeric child lineage as an attachment-order mechanism
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Anchor

- no-manual-carrier-renaming
  - Kind: excluded-scope
  - Description: do not prepend semantic project labels or otherwise rename the Tooling-projected primary Handoff package basename
  - Responsible Party Or Role: Anchor

## Completion Expectation

- Signal Kind: none
- Signal Meaning: fresh Anchor continues from corrected source and runtime-rebase discussion frontier
- Return To: Sigma
- Return To Reference: [Sigma Role](business::.topics/roles/001-4-sigma-role.trace.md)

## Reference Context

- none

## Interpretation Limits

- Does Not Mean: runtime rebase is implemented, final schema companions are all promoted, or remote commit/push occurred.
- Must Not Be Used To Claim: manual package naming/presentation is canonical when it differs from Tooling-projected human output.
